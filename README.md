#JPA

Jpa is a specification which facilitates object relational mapping to manage relational data in java applications

It provides a platform to work directly with objects instead of using sql statements.

It is used to persist data between Java object and relational database

JPA acts as a bridge between object-oriented domain models and relational database systems.


Since JPA is a specification, it doesn't perform any operation by itself. so it requires implementation.

#Examples for JPA Providers or Implementations in Java

Hibernate, TopLink, Ibatis, EclipseLink
